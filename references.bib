	abstract = {The virtual community of practice (VCoP) is a popular method for enhancing faculty's teaching competencies. However, a decrease in members’ engagement remains a common problem regarding VCoPs. In order to effectively motivate faculty to continue their participation, this study investigated why some faculty members could persistently engage in a VCoP for teaching. The expectancy-value theory of achievement motivation was employed to frame this research. Three faculty members who had fully participated in the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) VCoP were interviewed and their responses were examined using the thematic analysis method. Through the interviews and analyses, the author identified critical experiences that might contribute to these faculty members’ persistent engagement. Suggestions were proposed to instructional designers in the higher education system. It is expected that these suggestions can help these designers use VCoPs to continuously support faculty's improvement in teaching skills.},

	abstract = {Fifty years ago, a UCLA computer science professor and his student sent the first electronic message over a network called ARPANET, a predecessor to the Internet. The intended message, the word "login", was truncated in a computer crash to "lo." Digital infrastructure has made significant advances since then, but key decision points in the history of the Internet continue to reverberate today and have done much to shape not only cyberspace, but the twenty-first century.In Forks in the Digital Road, Scott J. Shackelford and Scott O. Bradner revisit the key decision points in the history of cybersecurity and Internet governance, revealing the alternative paths or "forks" that existed at the time and addressing the question of "what if?". What if encryption was built into the Internet's architecture from the beginning? What if Section 230, which shields Internet platforms from civil liability, had taken a different form? What if Cerf and Kahn had structured TCP/IP in another way? What if Tim Berners-Lee had taken the advice of counsel and patented the World Wide Web? And what if the US government had not gotten directly involved with Internet governance in 1998, or elected not to help launch a new era of cyber conflict in 2006?Shackelford and Bradner answer these questions, and many more. They explain how things might have been different if other paths had been followed and offer practical ideas to help build a new vision of cyberspace that is as secure, private, efficient, and fun as possible. At a time when the future of cyberspace has never been more in doubt--with the potential for a new Digital Cold War, or even a "splinternet" having the potential to fracture cyberspace into a series of national-level intranets in the wake of the war in Ukraine--the time is ripe to take both a look back, and ahead.},

	abstract = {Knowledge and learning exist as byproducts of social processes such as those that take place in communities of practice. We describe two frameworks for understanding and building online knowledge-building communities, or online communities of practice that enhance collective knowledge. First, the C4P framework is described as a way of understanding how knowledge is created and disseminated by participants in a community of practice. Second, we discuss ways in which technology provides added value for learning in these environments using the DDC (Design for Distributed Cognition) framework, and link this to the particular goals of a knowledge-building community. Examples from two large online communities are discussed.},
